# KaT
Key access Terminal: a customizable functional PHP framework structure for API.

For the moment, this is only a place older for the future publication of a bootstrap code for the KaT framework.

While it's being written again(last version is from 2006), You can follow an example usage on the pirl-php-api project here:

https://github.com/yanicky/pirl-php-api

Since the pirl-php-api code was forked, after just a few commits, i felt that a refactoring had to be done before getting into cool modular structure. Then i understood, that i cannot ignore that roaring KaT anymore. 

So a bootstrap version will be added in this repository, for future public usage, once a new(v3.0) KaT-base is finished. 

Please come back later.
