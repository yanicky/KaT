# KaT
Key access Terminal: a customizable functional PHP framework structure for API.

For the moment, this is a place holder for the publication of a bootstrap code for the KaT framework.

While the KaT_base is being written again(last version is from 2006), i will update this repository as a demo for the framework structure. 

I got inspired while contributing on pirl-php-api, so i included the original usage and all my contributed features in a smaller footprint.

Link to the pirl-php-api: <https://github.com/yanicky/pirl-php-api>

Since the pirl-php-api code was forked, after just a few commits, i felt that a refactoring had to be done before getting into cool modular structure. Then i understood, that i could not ignore that roaring KaT anymore. 

So a new bootstrap version is being created here, for public usage against contemporary Web3.0 DATA. Datastores will be added once a KaT_base(SQLite) is completed to handle modularity. 

The most basic concepts around KaT are:

1. A condition tree that is populated/validated in a non-blocking manner.

2. Input and Output are managed in KaT/ 

3. Data processing and functions are processed in KaT_base/.

4. A configurable minimalist approach allowing branches to be enabled/disabled easily.

## How to
Check the HOWTO.md <https://gitgub.com/yanicky/KaT/HOWTO.md>  or use CMD=howto for usage examples.

(While some CMD names might change in the future, they will be properly transitioned)

Feel free to add pull requests or fork it for your own usage.

### Still asking yourself what's a KaT? 
Well think of it as a simple application, flexible and agile as a Cat, but faithful and predictable as a dog.

Enjoy!

Please come back later.
