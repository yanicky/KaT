# KaT
Key access Terminal: a customizable functional PHP framework structure for API.

For the moment, this is only a place older for the future publication of a bootstrap code for the KaT framework.

While it's being written again(last version is from 2006), You can follow an example usage on the pirl-php-api project here:

https://github.com/yanicky/pirl-php-api

Since the code was forked, a refactoring had to be done before getting into KaT-modules.  

A bootstrap version will be added here for future use once a new KaT-base is finished.
